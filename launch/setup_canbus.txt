Make sure you have the 'can-utils' package.

$ sudo apt-get install can-utils

Then load the needed 'can' kernel modules
Check if they exist by using:

$ lsmod | grep can

Look for 'can', 'can_raw', and 'slcan'

If any of these do not exist use:

$ sudo modprobe [module]

Replace [module] with the one that does not exist, i.e. sudo modprobe slcan

To make them load automatically edit the /etc/modules folder

$ sudo nano /etc/modules

Add the three module names to the list, one on each line, then save.

Now you should be ready to use the 'slcan_add.sh' and 'slcan_remove.sh' files.
If you are having troubles getting it to connect, remove the USB from the CANbus
device, run the 'slcan_remove.sh' command, then reinsert the CANbus USB device
and rerun the 'slcan_add.sh' command. If all else fails, restart the computer
and try again.
