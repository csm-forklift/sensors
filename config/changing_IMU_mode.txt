Here is how to change the IMU mode.

Go to the Arduino "Libraries" folder (wherever that is on your computer, to find
it check the Arduino's IDE under "File -> Preferences" and it should be under
the "sketchbook location" folder) and open the file 
"Adafruit_BNO055/Adafruit_BNO055.h". Near the bottom, find the function "begin" 
and change the "mode" default value to the desired operating mode. Then you can 
resend the code to the Arduino. To see the different kinds of operating modes, 
consult the BNO055 data sheet page 20 for the operating mode descriptions.
